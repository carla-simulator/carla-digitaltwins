## 🗺️ Importing a Real Map from OpenStreetMap

7. Once the tool launches, a UI will appear with **three sections**:

   - **Filename** – your custom name for the map
   - **OSMURL** – the URL from OpenStreetMap
   - **LocalFilePath** – optional local saving path

8. Go to [https://www.openstreetmap.org](https://www.openstreetmap.org).

9. Search and zoom into the **area** you want to replicate.

10. Click the **Export** button on the top menu, the one in the upper part of the window which is between other buttons. NOT THE BLUE ONE.

## ⚙️ Generation and Preview

14. Unreal Engine might seem frozen — **don't worry**, it's processing the data.

    - You can check the progress in the **Output Log**.

## 📦 Importing the Generated Map into Another Unreal Project

Once the map generation process is complete:

1. **Close the Unreal Editor**.

2. Open your **file explorer** and navigate to the **`Plugins`** folder of the project where you originally generated the map.

3. Inside the `Plugins` folder, you will see a plugin folder named after the **map name** you entered in the Digital Twins UI.

4. **Copy that folder**.

5. Go to the target Unreal project (the one where you want to use the map) and paste the copied folder into its own `Plugins` directory.

6. Launch the target project. Unreal Engine will detect the plugin automatically and compile it if necessary.

> ✅ Tip: Make sure the target project is also using **Unreal Engine 4.26** to avoid compatibility issues.
